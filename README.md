## Abount Me

Hello, my name is Lucas Paiva. I'm 19 years old and new at the technology industry, but I have experience on working on computers since I was 9. I've always had the curiosity and the passion to understand it's mechanisms and inner workings. 
  It's with great happiness that I'm currently studying the I.T. area that I enjoy so much on the course of System Analysis and Development on Uninassau, a great university with great teachers, and it's being a very gratifying.
  I'm excited to have my first job officially on the area that i'm learning, to have new experiences and to add more to my personal and professional development.

 I'm a person who loves technology, and that enjoys learning new things or improving a knowledge that I already have. I've had great experiences reading books recommended by my professors, I'm up to date on the articles and I'm also having english classes provided by CNA NET, which I have nothing to complain about. I look forward to bettering even more my english as means to have acess to more informations in english and to go on exchange programs on the future.

  Well, that is me, Lucas Paiva, and I hope that you've enjoyed reading about me so far. If you have any questions, want to talk to me, make me a proposition or even to give me suggestions, feel free to contact me via Linkedin by chat. Also give a look on my portifolio, soon I'll be creating a site from the ground up, but for now I'll just have a simpler one with basic directions.
 That's all for now.

See you Later!! ♥
